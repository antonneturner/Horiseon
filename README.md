# Horiseon

A refactoring of an existing website to make it more accessible. 
Replaced the non semantic elements with semantic ones by replacing the excessive amount of divs with the proper semantic elements for increased and improved accessibliity for users. 
I used vscode and css to replace and remove duplicate and non semantic elements for improved accesibilty. 
I did this project to help create a more user friendly experience for our customers. 
I learned alot in this project. I learned how to read html files and how to make changes to them. I learned the difference between semantic and non semantic elements, i also learned the usage of the differing elments in conjugation with css.
